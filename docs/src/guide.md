This guide will teach you how to assemble SQL queries using FunSQL.


## Test Database

To demonstrate database queries, we need a test database.  The database we use
in this guide is a tiny 10 person sample of simulated patient data extracted
from a much larger [CMS DE-SynPuf
dataset](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Downloadable-Public-Use-Files/SynPUFs/DE_Syn_PUF).
For a database engine, we picked [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/).  Using
SQLite in a guide is convenient because it does not require a database server
to run and allows us to distribute the whole database as a single file.  FunSQL
supports SQLite and many other database engines.  The techniques discussed here
are not specific to SQLite and once you learn them, you will be able to apply
them to any SQL database.

The data in the test database is stored in the format of the [OMOP Common Data
Model](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/CommonDataModel.html), an open
source database schema for observational healthcare data.  In this guide, we
will only use a small fragment of the Common Data Model.

![Fragment of the OMOP Common Data Model](omop-common-data-model.drawio.svg)

The patient data, including basic demographic information, is stored in the
table `person`.  Patient addresses are stored in a separate table `location`,
linked to `person` by the key column `location_id`.

The bulk of patient data consists of clinical events: visits to healthcare
providers, recorded observations, diagnosed conditions, prescribed medications,
etc.  In this guide we only use two types of events, visits and conditions.

The specific type of the event (e.g., *Inpatient* visit or *Essential
hypertension* condition) is indicated using a *concept id* column, which refers
to the `concept` table.  Different concepts may be related to each other.  For
instance, *Essential hypertension* **is a** *Hypertensive disorder*, which
itself **is a** *Disorder of cardiovascular system*.  Concept relationships are
recorded in the corresponding table.

If you wish to follow along with the guide and run the examples, download the
[database
file](https://github.com/MechanicalRabbit/ohdsi-synpuf-demo/releases/download/20210412/synpuf-10p.sqlite):

```julia
DATABASE = download("https://github.com/MechanicalRabbit/ohdsi-synpuf-demo/releases/download/20210412/synpuf-10p.sqlite")
```

All examples in this guide are tested on each update using the
[NarrativeTest](https://github.com/MechanicalRabbit/NarrativeTest.jl) package.
To avoid downloading the database file all the time, we registered the download
URL as an [artifact](../Artifacts.toml) and use
[`Pkg.Artifacts`](http://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/artifacts/) API to fetch it:

    using Pkg.Artifacts, LazyArtifacts

    DATABASE = joinpath(artifact"synpuf-10p", "synpuf-10p.sqlite")
    #-> ⋮


## Using FunSQL

To interact with an SQLite database from Julia code, we need to install the
[SQLite](https://github.com/JuliaDatabases/SQLite.jl) package:

```julia
using Pkg

Pkg.add("SQLite")
```

With the package installed, we can open a database connection:

    using FunSQL
    using SQLite

    conn = DBInterface.connect(FunSQL.DB{SQLite.DB}, DATABASE)

This call to [`DBInterface.connect`](@ref) creates a connection to the SQLite
database, retrieves the catalog of available database tables, and returns a
FunSQL connection object.

Some applications open many connections to the same database.  For instance, a
web application may open a new database connection on every incoming HTTP
request.  In this case, it may be worth to have all these connections to
share the same database catalog.  The application can start with loading
the catalog using using [`reflect`](@ref).

    using FunSQL: reflect

    catalog = reflect(DBInterface.connect(SQLite.DB, DATABASE))

Then whenever a new connection is created, this catalog object could be reused.

    conn = FunSQL.DB(DBInterface.connect(SQLite.DB, DATABASE),
                     catalog = catalog)

!!! warning

    Some database drivers, including the PostgreSQL client library
    [LibPQ.jl](https://github.com/invenia/LibPQ.jl), do not support
    DBInterface.  For instructions on how to enable DBInterface for LibPQ, see
    [this example](@ref Database-connection-with-LibPQ.jl).

Using the connection object, we can execute FunSQL queries.  For example, the
following query outputs the content of the table `person`:

    using FunSQL: From

    q = From(:person)

This query could be executed with [`DBInterface.execute`](@ref).

    res = DBInterface.execute(conn, q)

To display the result of a query, it is convenient to convert it to a
[DataFrame](https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFrames.jl) object.

    using DataFrames

    DataFrame(res)
    #=>
    10×18 DataFrame
     Row │ person_id  gender_concept_id  year_of_birth  month_of_birth  day_of_bir ⋯
         │ Int64      Int64              Int64          Int64           Int64      ⋯

       2 │     30091               8532           1932               8

       6 │     72120               8507           1937              10
       7 │     82328               8532           1957               9
       8 │     95538               8507           1923              11

      10 │    110862               8507           1911               4
                                                                  14 columns omitted
    =#

Instead of executing the query directly, we can [`render`](@ref) it to generate
the corresponding SQL statement.

    using FunSQL: render

    sql = render(conn, q)

    print(sql)
    #=>
    SELECT
      "person_1"."person_id",
      "person_1"."gender_concept_id",
      "person_1"."year_of_birth",
      "person_1"."month_of_birth",
      "person_1"."day_of_birth",
      "person_1"."time_of_birth",
      "person_1"."race_concept_id",
      "person_1"."ethnicity_concept_id",
      "person_1"."location_id",
      "person_1"."provider_id",
      "person_1"."care_site_id",
      "person_1"."person_source_value",
      "person_1"."gender_source_value",
      "person_1"."gender_source_concept_id",
      "person_1"."race_source_value",
      "person_1"."race_source_concept_id",
      "person_1"."ethnicity_source_value",
      "person_1"."ethnicity_source_concept_id"
    FROM "person" AS "person_1"
    =#

In fact, we do not need a database connection if all we want is to generate a
SQL query.  For this purpose, we only need a [`SQLCatalog`](@ref) object that
describes the structure of the database tables and the target SQL dialect.

    using FunSQL: SQLCatalog, SQLTable

    catalog = SQLCatalog(SQLTable(:person, columns = [:person_id, :year_of_birth]),
                         dialect = :sqlite)

    sql = render(catalog, q)

    print(sql)
    #=>
    SELECT
      "person_1"."person_id",
      "person_1"."year_of_birth"
    FROM "person" AS "person_1"
    =#


## Why FunSQL?

Let us clarify the purpose of FunSQL.  Consider a problem:

*Find all patients born between 1930 and 1940 and living in Illinois, and for
each patient show their current age (by the end of 2020).*

The answer can be obtained with the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT p.person_id, 2020 - p.year_of_birth AS age
FROM person p
JOIN location l ON (p.location_id = l.location_id)
WHERE (p.year_of_birth BETWEEN 1930 AND 1940) AND (l.state = 'IL')
```

The simplest way to incorporate this query into Julia code is to embed it as a
string literal:

    sql = """
    SELECT p.person_id, 2020 - p.year_of_birth AS age
    FROM person p
    JOIN location l ON (p.location_id = l.location_id)
    WHERE (p.year_of_birth BETWEEN 1930 AND 1940) AND (l.state = 'IL')
    """

    DBInterface.execute(conn, sql) |> DataFrame
    #=>
    1×2 DataFrame
     Row │ person_id  age
         │ Int64      Int64
    ─────┼──────────────────
       1 │     72120     83
    =#

With FunSQL, instead of embedding the SQL query directly into Julia code, we
construct a *query object*:

    using FunSQL: As, From, Fun, Get, Join, Select, Where

    q = From(:person) |>
        Where(Fun.between(Get.year_of_birth, 1930, 1940)) |>
        Join(From(:location) |> Where(Get.state .== "IL") |> As(:location),
             on = Get.location_id .== Get.location.location_id) |>
        Select(Get.person_id, :age => 2020 .- Get.year_of_birth)

The value of `q` is a composite object of type [`SQLNode`](@ref).  "Composite"
means that `q` is assembled from components (also of type `SQLNode`), which
themselves are either atomic or assembled from smaller components.  Different
kinds of components are created by `SQLNode` constructors such as
[`From`](@ref), [`Where`](@ref), [`Fun`](@ref), [`Get`](@ref), etc.

We use the same `DBInterface.execute` method to serialize the query object as a
SQL statement and immediately execute it:

    DBInterface.execute(conn, q) |> DataFrame
    #=>
    1×2 DataFrame
     Row │ person_id  age
         │ Int64      Int64
    ─────┼──────────────────
       1 │     72120     83
    =#

Why, instead of embedding a complete SQL query, we prefer to generate it
through a query object?  To justify this extra step, consider that in a real
Julia program, any query is likely going to be parameterized:

*Find all patients born between `$start_year` and `$end_year` and living in
`$states`, and for each patient show the `$output_columns`.*

If this is the case, the SQL query cannot be prepared in advance and must be
assembled on the fly.  While it is possible to assemble a SQL query from string
fragments, it is tedious, error-prone and definitely not fun.  FunSQL provides
a more robust and effective approach: build the query as a composite data
structure.

Here is how this parameterized query may be constructed with FunSQL:

    function FindPatients(; start_year = nothing,
                            end_year = nothing,
                            states = String[])
        q = From(:person) |>
            Where(BirthRange(start_year, end_year))
        if !isempty(states)
            q = q |>
                Join(:location => From(:location) |>
                                  Where(Fun.in(Get.state, states...)),
                     on = Get.location_id .== Get.location.location_id)
        end
        q
    end

    function BirthRange(start_year, end_year)
        p = true
        if start_year !== nothing
            p = Fun.and(p, Get.year_of_birth .>= start_year)
        end
        if end_year !== nothing
            p = Fun.and(p, Get.year_of_birth .<= end_year)
        end
        p
    end

The function `FindPatients` effectively becomes a new `SQLNode` constructor,
which can be used directly or as a component of a larger query.

*Show all patient data.*

    q = FindPatients()

## Tabular Operations

Recall the query from the [previous section](@ref Why-FunSQL?):

*Find all patients born between 1930 and 1940 and living in Illinois, and for
each patient show their current age.*

    From(:person) |>
    Where(Fun.between(Get.year_of_birth, 1930, 1940)) |>
    Join(From(:location) |> Where(Get.state .== "IL") |> As(:location),
         on = Get.location_id .== Get.location.location_id) |>
    Select(Get.person_id, :age => 2020 .- Get.year_of_birth)

At the outer level, this query is constructed from tabular operations `From`,
`Where`, `Join`, and `Select` arranged in a pipeline by the pipe (`|>`)
operator.  In SQL, a *tabular operation* takes a certain number of input
datasets and produces an output dataset.  It is helpful to visualize a tabular
operation as a node with a certain number of input arrows and one output arrow.

![From, Where, Select, and Join nodes](from-where-select-join-nodes.drawio.svg)

Then the whole query can be visualized as a pipeline diagram.  Each arrow in
this diagram represents a dataset, and each node represents an elementary data
processing operation.

![Query pipeline](person-by-birth-year-range-and-state.drawio.svg)

The following tabular operations are available in FunSQL.

| Constructor           | Function                                          |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| [`Append`](@ref)      | concatenate datasets                              |
| [`As`](@ref)          | wrap all columns in a nested record               |
| [`Define`](@ref)      | add an output column                              |
| [`From`](@ref)        | produce the content of a database table           |
| [`Group`](@ref)       | partition the dataset into disjoint groups        |
| [`Iterate`](@ref)     | iterate a query                                   |
| [`Join`](@ref)        | correlate two datasets                            |
| [`Limit`](@ref)       | truncate the dataset                              |
| [`Order`](@ref)       | sort the dataset                                  |
| [`Partition`](@ref)   | relate dataset rows to each other                 |
| [`Select`](@ref)      | specify output columns                            |
| [`Where`](@ref)       | filter the dataset by the given condition         |
| [`With`](@ref)        | assign a name to a temporary dataset              |


## `From`, `Select`, and `Define`

The [`From`](@ref) node outputs the content of a database table.  The
constructor takes one argument, the name of the table.

As opposed to SQL, FunSQL does not demand that all queries have an explicit
`Select`.  The following query will produce all columns of the table:

*Show all patients.*

    using FunSQL: From

    q = From(:person)

    render(conn, q) |> print
    #=>
    SELECT
      "person_1"."person_id",
      ⋮
      "person_1"."ethnicity_source_concept_id"
    FROM "person" AS "person_1"
    =#

It is possible for a query not to have a `From` node:

*Show the current date and time.*

    using FunSQL: Select

    q = Select(Fun.current_timestamp())

    sql = render(q)

    print(sql)
    #-> SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS "current_timestamp"

In this query, the `Select` node is not connected to any source of data.  In
such a case, it is supplied with a *unit dataset* containing one row and no
columns.  Hence this query will generate one row of output.

The same effect could be achieved with `From(nothing)`.

    q = From(nothing) |>
        Select(Fun.current_timestamp())

    sql = render(q)

    print(sql)
    #-> SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS "current_timestamp"

The [`Select`](@ref) node is used to specify the output columns.  The name of
the column is either derived from the expression or set explicitly with
[`As`](@ref) (or the shorthand `=>`).

*For each patient, show their ID and the current age.*

    q = From(:person) |>
        Select(Get.person_id,
               :age => 2020 .- Get.year_of_birth)

    render(conn, q) |> print
    #=>
    SELECT
      "person_1"."person_id",
      (2020 - "person_1"."year_of_birth") AS "age"
    FROM "person" AS "person_1"
    =#

To add a new column while preserving existing output columns, we use the
[`Define`](@ref) node.

*Show the patient data together with their current age.*

    using FunSQL: Define

    q = From(:person) |>
        Define(:age => 2020 .- Get.year_of_birth)

    render(conn, q) |> print
    #=>
    SELECT
      "person_1"."person_id",
      ⋮
      "person_1"."ethnicity_source_concept_id",
      (2020 - "person_1"."year_of_birth") AS "age"
    FROM "person" AS "person_1"
    =#

`Define` could also be used to replace an existing column.

*Hide the day of birth of patients born before 1930.*

    q = From(:person) |>
        Define(:day_of_birth => Fun.case(Get.year_of_birth .>= 1930,
                                         Get.day_of_birth,
                                         missing))

    render(conn, q) |> print
    #=>
    SELECT
      "person_1"."person_id",
      "person_1"."gender_concept_id",
      "person_1"."year_of_birth",
      "person_1"."month_of_birth",
      (CASE WHEN ("person_1"."year_of_birth" >= 1930) THEN "person_1"."day_of_birth" ELSE NULL END) AS "day_of_birth",
      ⋮
      "person_1"."ethnicity_source_concept_id"
    FROM "person" AS "person_1"
    =#


## `Join`

The [`Join`](@ref) node correlates the rows of two input datasets.
Predominantly, `Join` is used for looking up table records by key.  In the
following example, `Join` associates each `person` record with their `location`
using the key column `location_id` that uniquely identifies a `location`
record:

*Show all patients together with their state of residence.*

    From(:person) |>
    Join(:location => From(:location),
         Get.location_id .== Get.location.location_id,
         left = true) |>
    Select(Get.person_id, Get.location.state)

The modifier `left = true` tells `Join` that it must output *all* `person`
records including those without the corresponding `location`.  Since this is a
very common requirement, FunSQL provides an alias:

    using FunSQL: LeftJoin

    From(:person) |>
    LeftJoin(:location => From(:location),
             Get.location_id .== Get.location.location_id) |>
    Select(Get.person_id, Get.location.state)

Since `Join` needs two input datasets, it must be attached to two input
pipelines.  The first pipeline is attached using the `|>` operator and the
second one is provided as an argument to the `Join` constructor.
Alternatively, both input pipelines can be specified as keyword arguments:

    Join(over = From(:person),
         joinee = :location => From(:location),
         on = Get.location_id .== Get.location.location_id,
         left = true) |>
    Select(Get.person_id, Get.location.state)

The output of `Join` combines columns of both input datasets, which will cause
ambiguity if both datasets have a column with the same name.  Such is the case
in the previous example since both tables, `person` and `location`, have a
column called `location_id`.  To disambiguate them, we can place all columns of
one of the datasets into a nested record.  This is the action of the arrow
(`=>`) operator or its full form, the `As` node:

    using FunSQL: As

    From(:person) |>
    LeftJoin(From(:location) |> As(:location),
             on = Get.location_id .== Get.location.location_id) |>
    Select(Get.person_id, Get.location.state)

Alternatively, we could use *bound column references*, which are described
in a [later section](@ref Get).


## Scalar Operations

Many tabular operations including `Join`, `Select` and `Where` are
parameterized with scalar operations.  A *scalar operation* acts on an
individual row of a dataset and produces a scalar value.  Scalar operations are
assembled from literal values, column references, and applications of SQL
functions and operators.  Below is a list of scalar operations available in
FunSQL.

| Constructor           | Function                                          |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| [`Agg`](@ref)         | apply an aggregate function                       |
| [`As`](@ref)          | assign a column alias                             |
| [`Bind`](@ref)        | create a correlated subquery                      |
| [`Fun`](@ref)         | apply a scalar function or a scalar operator      |
| [`Get`](@ref)         | produce the value of a column                     |
| [`Lit`](@ref)         | produce a constant value                          |
| [`Sort`](@ref)        | indicate the sort order                           |
| [`Var`](@ref)         | produce the value of a query parameter            |


## `Lit`: SQL Literals

The [`Lit`](@ref) node creates a literal value, although we could usually omit
the constructor:

    using FunSQL: Lit

    Select(Lit(42))
    Select(42)

The SQL value `NULL` is represented by the Julia constant `missing`:

    q = Select(missing)

    render(conn, q) |> print
    #-> SELECT NULL AS "_"


## `Get`: Column References

The [`Get`](@ref) node creates a column reference.  The `Get` constructor
admits several equivalent forms:

    Get.year_of_birth
    Get(:year_of_birth)
    Get."year_of_birth"
    Get("year_of_birth")

Such column references are resolved at the place of use against the input
dataset.  As we mentioned earlier, sometimes column references cannot be
resolved unambiguously.  To alleviate this problem, we can bind the column
reference to the node that produces it:

*Show all patients with their state of residence.*

    qₚ = From(:person)
    qₗ = From(:location)
    q = qₚ |>
        LeftJoin(qₗ, on = qₚ.location_id .== qₗ.location_id) |>
        Select(qₚ.person_id, qₗ.state)

The notation `qₚ.location_id` and `qₗ.location_id` is a syntax sugar for

    Get(:location_id, over = qₚ)
    Get(:location_id, over = qₗ)


## `Fun`: SQL Functions and Operators

SQL functions and operators are represented using the [`Fun`](@ref) node, which
also has several equivalent forms:

    Fun.between(Get.year_of_birth, 1930, 1940)
    Fun(:between, Get.year_of_birth, 1930, 1940)
    Fun."between"(Get.year_of_birth, 1930, 1940)
    Fun("between", Get.year_of_birth, 1930, 1940)

Certain SQL operators, notably comparison operators, can be represented using
Julia broadcasting notation:

    Fun.">="(Get.year_of_birth, 1930)
    Get.year_of_birth .>= 1930

We should note that FunSQL does not verify if a SQL function or an operator is
used correctly or even whether it exists or not.  In such a case, FunSQL will
generate a SQL query that fails to execute:

    q = From(:person) |>
        Select(Fun.frobnicate(Get.year_of_birth))

    render(conn, q) |> print
    #=>
    SELECT FROBNICATE("person_1"."year_of_birth") AS "frobnicate"
    FROM "person" AS "person_1"
    =#

    DBInterface.execute(conn, q)
    #-> ERROR: SQLite.SQLiteException("no such function: FROBNICATE")

On the other hand, FunSQL will correctly serialize many SQL functions and
operators that have irregular syntax including `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `IN`,
`EXISTS`, `CASE`, and others:

*Show the demographic cohort of each patient.*

    q = From(:person) |>
        Select(Fun.case(Get.year_of_birth .<= 1960, "boomer", "millenial"))

    render(conn, q) |> print
    #=>
    SELECT (CASE WHEN ("person_1"."year_of_birth" <= 1960) THEN 'boomer' ELSE 'millenial' END) AS "case"
    FROM "person" AS "person_1"
    =#


## `Group` and Aggregate Functions

[`Group`](@ref) and aggregate functions are used for summarizing data to report
totals, averages and so on.  We start by applying the `Group` node to partition
the input rows into disjoint groups.  Then, for each group, we can calculate
summary values using aggregate functions.  In FunSQL, aggregate functions are
created using the [`Agg`](@ref) node.  In the following example, we use the
aggregate function `Agg.count`, which simply counts the number of rows in each
group.

*Show the number of patients by the year of birth.*

    using FunSQL: Agg, Group

    q = From(:person) |>
        Group(Get.year_of_birth) |>
        Select(Get.year_of_birth, Agg.count())

    render(conn, q) |> print
    #=>
    SELECT
      "person_1"."year_of_birth",
      COUNT(*) AS "count"
    FROM "person" AS "person_1"
    GROUP BY "person_1"."year_of_birth"
    =#

    DBInterface.execute(conn, q) |> DataFrame
    #=>
    10×2 DataFrame
     Row │ year_of_birth  count
         │ Int64          Int64
    ─────┼──────────────────────
       1 │          1911      1
       2 │          1913      1
       3 │          1922      1
    ⋮
    =#

To indicate that aggregate functions must be applied to the dataset as a whole,
we create a `Group` node without arguments.  This is the case where FunSQL
notation deviates from SQL, where we would omit the `GROUP BY` clause to
achieve the same effect.

*Show the average year of birth.*

    q = From(:person) |>
        Group() |>
        Select(Agg.avg(Get.year_of_birth))

    render(conn, q) |> print
    #=>
    SELECT AVG("person_1"."year_of_birth") AS "avg"
    FROM "person" AS "person_1"
    =#

    DBInterface.execute(conn, q) |> DataFrame
    #=>
    1×1 DataFrame
     Row │ avg
         │ Float64
    ─────┼─────────
       1 │  1935.4
    =#

In general, the arguments of the `Group` node form the *grouping key*
so that two rows of the input dataset belongs to the same group when
they have the same value of the grouping key.  The output of `Group` contains
all distinct values of the grouping key.

*Show the US states that are present in the location records.*

    q = From(:location) |>
        Group(Get.state)

    render(conn, q) |> print
    #=>
    SELECT DISTINCT "location_1"."state"
    FROM "location" AS "location_1"
    =#

    DBInterface.execute(conn, q) |> DataFrame
    #=>
    10×1 DataFrame
     Row │ state
         │ String
    ─────┼────────
       1 │ MI
       2 │ WA
       3 │ FL
    ⋮
    =#

FunSQL has no lexical limitations on the use of aggregate functions.  While in
SQL aggregate functions can only be used in the `SELECT` or `HAVING` clauses,
there is no such restriction in FunSQL: they could be used in any context where
an ordinary expression is permitted.  The only requirement is that for each
aggregate function, FunSQL can determine the corresponding `Group` node.  It is
convenient to imagine that the output of `Group` contains the grouped rows,
which cannot be observed directly, but whose presence in the output allows us
to apply aggregate functions.

In particular, we use a regular `Where` node where SQL would require a `HAVING`
clause.

*Show patients who saw a doctor within the last year.*

    q = From(:visit_occurrence) |>
        Group(Get.person_id) |>
        Where(Agg.max(Get.visit_end_date) .>= Fun.date("now", "-1 year"))

    render(conn, q) |> print
    #=>
    SELECT "visit_occurrence_1"."person_id"
    FROM "visit_occurrence" AS "visit_occurrence_1"
    GROUP BY "visit_occurrence_1"."person_id"
    HAVING (MAX("visit_occurrence_1"."visit_end_date") >= DATE('now', '-1 year'))
    =#

When the output of `Group` is blocked by an `As` node, we need to traverse it
with `Get` in order to use an aggregate function.

*For each patient, show the date of their latest visit to a doctor.*

    q = From(:person) |>
        LeftJoin(:visit_group => From(:visit_occurrence) |> Group(Get.person_id),
                 on = Get.person_id .== Get.visit_group.person_id) |>
        Select(Get.person_id,
               Get.visit_group |> Agg.max(Get.visit_start_date))

    render(conn, q) |> print
    #=>
    SELECT
      "person_1"."person_id",
      "visit_group_1"."max"
    FROM "person" AS "person_1"
    LEFT JOIN (
      SELECT
        "visit_occurrence_1"."person_id",
        MAX("visit_occurrence_1"."visit_start_date") AS "max"
      FROM "visit_occurrence" AS "visit_occurrence_1"
      GROUP BY "visit_occurrence_1"."person_id"
    ) AS "visit_group_1" ON ("person_1"."person_id" = "visit_group_1"."person_id")
    =#


## `Partition` and Window Functions

We can relate each row to other rows in the same dataset using the
[`Partition`](@ref) node and *window functions*.  We start by applying the
`Partition` node to partition the input rows into disjoint groups.  The rows in
each group are reordered according to the given sort order.  Unlike `Group`,
which collapses each row group into a single row, the `Partition` node
preserves the original rows, but allows us to relate each row to adjacent rows
in the same partition.  In particular, we can apply regular aggregate
functions, which calculate the summary value of a subset of rows related to the
current row.

In the following example, the rows `visit_occurrence` are partitioned per
patient and ordered by the starting date of the visit.  The `frame` clause
specifies the subset of rows relative to the current row (the *window frame*)
to be used by aggregate functions.  In this example, the frame contains all
rows prior to the current row.

*For each visit, show the time passed since the previous visit.*

    using FunSQL: Partition

    q = From(:visit_occurrence) |>
        Partition(Get.person_id,
                  order_by = [Get.visit_start_date],
                  frame = (mode = :rows, start = -Inf, finish = -1)) |>
        Select(Get.person_id,
               Get.visit_start_date,
               Get.visit_end_date,
               :gap => Fun.julianday(Get.visit_start_date) .- Fun.julianday(Agg.max(Get.visit_end_date)))

    render(conn, q) |> print
    #=>
    SELECT
      "visit_occurrence_1"."person_id",
      "visit_occurrence_1"."visit_start_date",
      "visit_occurrence_1"."visit_end_date",
      (JULIANDAY("visit_occurrence_1"."visit_start_date") - JULIANDAY((MAX("visit_occurrence_1"."visit_end_date") OVER (PARTITION BY "visit_occurrence_1"."person_id" ORDER BY "visit_occurrence_1"."visit_start_date" ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING)))) AS "gap"
    FROM "visit_occurrence" AS "visit_occurrence_1"
    =#

    DBInterface.execute(conn, q) |> DataFrame
    #=>
    27×4 DataFrame
     Row │ person_id  visit_start_date  visit_end_date  gap

## Query Parameters

A SQL query may include a reference to a *query parameter*.  When we execute
such a query, we must supply the actual values for all parameters used in the
query.  This is a restricted form of dynamic query construction directly
supported by SQL syntax.

*Show all patients born between `$start_year` and `$end_year`.*

    sql = """
    SELECT p.person_id
    FROM person p
    WHERE p.year_of_birth BETWEEN ? AND ?
    """

    DBInterface.execute(conn, sql, (1930, 1940)) |> DataFrame
    #=>
    3×1 DataFrame
     Row │ person_id
         │ Int64
    ─────┼───────────
       1 │      1780
       2 │     30091
       3 │     72120
    =#

FunSQL can be used to construct a query with parameters.  Similar to `Get`,
parameter references are created using the [`Var`](@ref) node.

    using FunSQL: Var

    q = From(:person) |>
        Where(Fun.between(Get.year_of_birth, Var.START_YEAR, Var.END_YEAR)) |>
        Select(Get.person_id)

    render(conn, q) |> print
    #=>
    SELECT "person_1"."person_id"
    FROM "person" AS "person_1"
    WHERE ("person_1"."year_of_birth" BETWEEN ?1 AND ?2)
    =#

While we specified parameters by name, in the generated SQL query the same
parameters are numbered.  FunSQL will automatically [`pack`](@ref) named
parameters in the order in which they appear in the SQL query.

    DBInterface.execute(conn, q, START_YEAR = 1930, END_YEAR = 1940) |> DataFrame
    #=>
    3×1 DataFrame
     Row │ person_id
         │ Int64
    ─────┼───────────
       1 │      1780
       2 │     30091
       3 │     72120
    =#


## Correlated Queries

An *inner query* is a SQL query that is included into the *outer query* a part
of a scalar expression.  An inner query must either produce a single value or
be used as an argument of a query operator, such as `IN` or `EXISTS`, which
transforms the query output to a scalar value.

It is easy to assemble an inner query with FunSQL.

*Find the oldest patients.*

    qᵢ = From(:person) |>
         Group() |>
         Select(Agg.min(Get.year_of_birth))

    qₒ = From(:person) |>
         Where(Get.year_of_birth .== qᵢ) |>
         Select(Get.person_id, Get.year_of_birth)

    render(conn, qₒ) |> print
    #=>
    SELECT
      "person_1"."person_id",
      "person_1"."year_of_birth"
    FROM "person" AS "person_1"
    WHERE ("person_1"."year_of_birth" = (
      SELECT MIN("person_2"."year_of_birth") AS "min"
      FROM "person" AS "person_2"
    ))
    =#

    DBInterface.execute(conn, qₒ) |> DataFrame
    #=>
    1×2 DataFrame
     Row │ person_id  year_of_birth
         │ Int64      Int64
    ─────┼──────────────────────────
       1 │    110862           1911
    =#

*Find patients with no visits to a healthcare provider.*

    qᵢ = From(:visit_occurrence) |>
         Select(Get.person_id)

    qₒ = From(:person) |>
         Where(Fun."not in"(Get.person_id, qᵢ))

    render(conn, qₒ) |> print
    #=>
    SELECT
      "person_1"."person_id",
      ⋮
      "person_1"."ethnicity_source_concept_id"
    FROM "person" AS "person_1"
    WHERE ("person_1"."person_id" NOT IN (
      SELECT "visit_occurrence_1"."person_id"
      FROM "visit_occurrence" AS "visit_occurrence_1"
    ))
    =#

    DBInterface.execute(conn, qₒ) |> DataFrame
    #=>
    0×18 DataFrame
    =#

The inner query may depend on the data from the outer query.  Such inner queries
are called *correlated*.  In FunSQL, correlated queries are created using the
[`Bind`](@ref) node.  Specifically, in the body of a correlated query we use
[query parameters](@ref Query-Parameters) to refer to the external data.  The
`Bind` node, which wrap the correlated query, binds each parameter to an
expression evaluated in the context of the outer query.

*Find all visits where at least one condition was diagnosed.*

    using FunSQL: Bind

    CorrelatedCondition(person_id, start_date, end_date) =
        From(:condition_occurrence) |>
        Where(Fun.and(Get.person_id .== Var.PERSON_ID,
                      Fun.between(Get.condition_start_date, Var.START_DATE, Var.END_DATE))) |>
        Bind(:PERSON_ID => person_id,
             :START_DATE => start_date,
             :END_DATE => end_date)

    q = From(:visit_occurrence) |>
        Where(Fun.exists(CorrelatedCondition(Get.person_id, Get.visit_start_date, Get.visit_end_date)))

    render(conn, q) |> print
    #=>
    SELECT
      "visit_occurrence_1"."visit_occurrence_id",
      ⋮
      "visit_occurrence_1"."visit_source_concept_id"
    FROM "visit_occurrence" AS "visit_occurrence_1"
    WHERE (EXISTS (
      SELECT NULL
      FROM "condition_occurrence" AS "condition_occurrence_1"
      WHERE
        ("condition_occurrence_1"."person_id" = "visit_occurrence_1"."person_id") AND
        ("condition_occurrence_1"."condition_start_date" BETWEEN "visit_occurrence_1"."visit_start_date" AND "visit_occurrence_1"."visit_end_date")
    ))
    =#


## `Order` and `Limit`

The database server emits the output rows in an arbitrary order.  In fact,
different runs of the same query may produce rows in a different order.  To
specify a particular order of output rows, we use the [`Order`](@ref) node.

*Show patients ordered by the year of birth.*

    using FunSQL: Order

    q = From(:person) |>
        Order(Get.year_of_birth)

    render(conn, q) |> print
    #=>
    SELECT
      "person_1"."person_id",
      ⋮
      "person_1"."ethnicity_source_concept_id"
    FROM "person" AS "person_1"
    ORDER BY "person_1"."year_of_birth"
    =#

The [`Asc`](@ref) and the [`Desc`](@ref) modifiers specify whether to sort
the rows in an ascending or in a descending order.

*Show patients ordered by the year of birth in the descending order.*

    using FunSQL: Desc

    q = From(:person) |>
        Order(Get.year_of_birth |> Desc())

    render(conn, q) |> print
    #=>
    SELECT
      "person_1"."person_id",
      ⋮
      "person_1"."ethnicity_source_concept_id"
    FROM "person" AS "person_1"
    ORDER BY "person_1"."year_of_birth" DESC
    =#

The [`Limit`](@ref) node lets us take a slice of the input dataset.  To make
the output deterministic, `Limit` must be applied right after `Order`.

*Show the top three oldest patients.*

    using FunSQL: Limit

    q = From(:person) |>
        Order(Get.year_of_birth) |>
        Limit(1:3)

    render(conn, q) |> print
    #=>
    SELECT
      "person_1"."person_id",
      ⋮
      "person_1"."ethnicity_source_concept_id"
    FROM "person" AS "person_1"
    ORDER BY "person_1"."year_of_birth"
    LIMIT 3
    OFFSET 0
    =#


## `Append` and `Iterate`

The [`Append`](@ref) node concatenates two or more input datasets.  Only the
columns that are present in every input dataset will be included to the output.

*Show all clinical events (visits and conditions) associated with each patient.*

For a second example, consider the table `concept`, which contains the
vocabulary of medical concepts (such as *Myocardial Infarction*).  These
concepts may be related to each other (*Myocardial Infarction* has a subtype
*Acute Myocardial Infarction*), and their relationships are stored in the table
`concept_relationship`.  We can encapsulate construction of a query that finds
immediate subtypes as the function:

    SubtypesOf(base) =
        From(:concept) |>
        Join(From(:concept_relationship) |>
             Where(Get.relationship_id .== "Is a"),
             on = Get.concept_id .== Get.concept_id_1) |>
        Join(:base => base,
             on = Get.concept_id_2 .== Get.base.concept_id)

*Show the concept "Myocardial Infarction" and its immediate subtypes.*

    base = From(:concept) |>
           Where(Get.concept_name .== "Myocardial infarction")

    q = base |> Append(SubtypesOf(base))

    DBInterface.execute(conn, q) |> DataFrame
    #=>

       2 │     312327  Acute myocardial infarction  Condition  SNOMED         Clin
                                                                   3 columns omitted

But how can we fetch not just immediate, but all of the subtypes of a concept?

*Show the concept "Myocardial Infarction" and all of its subtypes.*

A good start is to repeatedly apply `SubtypesOf` and concatenate all the
outputs:

    base |>
    Append(SubtypesOf(base),
           SubtypesOf(SubtypesOf(base)),
           SubtypesOf(SubtypesOf(SubtypesOf(base))),
           SubtypesOf(SubtypesOf(SubtypesOf(SubtypesOf(base)))))

However we do not know if 4 iterations of `SubtypesOf` is enough to
fully traverse the concept hierarchy.  Ideally, we should continue
applying `SubtypesOf` until the last iteration produces an empty output.
This is exactly the action of the [`Iterate`](@ref) node.

    q = base |>
        Iterate(:subtype => SubtypesOf(From(:subtype)))
